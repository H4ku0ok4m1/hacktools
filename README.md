# hacktools
Quick "download the tools list". Tools are mainly for pentesting, more tools will be added overtime.

The tools list to be downloaded is located in the file githubtools.lst, just copy/paste new github urls to it.

A second optional file is called gitskip.lst, this file takes the name of the repo you dont want to be downloaded or updated and skips it.(Instead of erasing the name from the githubtools.lst file and forgetting the tool ever existed)

IE:
If url is: https://github.com/H4ku0ok4m1/hacktools.git
only enter "hacktools" in the gitskip.lst file

All tools get downloaded to /opt directory.

NOTE: This does NOT install the tools, only downloads/updates them.
